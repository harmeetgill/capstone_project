<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Here's a blank template to get started:
**To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following:**
`github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`

In the UK, between 2015 and 2017, there were 357,000 new cases of cancer, which is roughly 1,000 new cases a day (1). In 2018, worldwide there were an estimated 9.6 million deaths associated with cancer (2). Access to clinical data associated with cancer patients presents its own set of challenges, for example, manual data entry and lack of real-time access. Therefore, with this project I wanted to determine whether I could use an open data source for clinical features associated with cancer diagnoses and treatment to predict the cancer type.

The data source used was cBioPortal for cancer genomics (3).
